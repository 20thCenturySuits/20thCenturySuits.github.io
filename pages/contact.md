[Heather Milam](https://theatre.indiana.edu/about/faculty/milam-heather.html) is a Professor of Practice for Costume Technology in the Department of Theatre, Drama, and Contemporary Dance at Indiana University. She is also the Director of Undergraduate Studies.

A native New Yorker, Heather obtained her bachelor’s degree in theatre from Ithaca College in the mid-nineties. Upon graduation, she moved to NYC where she worked making Broadway costumes at Barbara Matera Ltd. She worked as a cutter, first hand, pattern maker and assistant draper over her years of service with the shop. She worked on such shows as *Spamalot*, *Mama Mia*, *Movin’ Out*, *Thoroughly Modern Millie*, *The Lion King*, *Aida*, *Beauty and the Beast*, *Sunset Boulevard* and *Show Boat*, as well as 101 & 102 Dalmatians (the movies), many ballets (NYC, ABT, SF), several operas, the finale costume for Cher’s 2003 Farewell Tour, the Rolling Stone’s 1995 Voodoo Lounge Tour and more.

This project is drawn from her experience helping costumers-in-training alter suit jackets for use in period-accurate plays and musicals.
