## Measuring guide

Before you start measuring, make sure you've read through this guide. It contains a number of measurements that we use to calculate proportions and match your suit to the suits in our [Reference Database](/suitmatch).

Once you're done, [enter your suit measurements](https://airtable.com/shrH8RqeQPgSZp4eG) and we'll show you which suits in our reference-model database match most closely.

### Basic Suit Information

- Measurement technique: will you be measuring a suit on a form or flat on a table or hangar
- Suit year start/end: the date range the suit originated in

### Collar and Lapel

- Lapel style: notched, peak, cloverleaf
